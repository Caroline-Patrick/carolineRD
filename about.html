            <h3>Caroline Patrick MS RD LD</h3>
            
            <p>I'm a two-time graduate of Boston University where I received undergraduate and graduate degrees in Nutrition. I completed an accredited dietetic internship at Newton-Wellesley Hospital (also a teaching hospital for Harvard Medical School Students - soaked in all I could). Since becoming a board-certified dietitian, I've been working with patients in the field of behavioral health.

            <p>On my own food journey, I struggled with disordered eating and body image issues for years. It began in 4th grade and continued into my undergraduate college experience. It felt unbearably shameful to be studying nutrition and secretly feel so out of control with food myself. Everything changed when I was introduced to intuitive eating. I was able to rebuild my relationship with food, my body, and my beliefs around health.  Finally, self-care and wellness felt a lot more expansive and welcoming. I was no longer confined by food rules and impossible weight goals.

            <p>My challenges have offered me a deep understanding of the struggles many women face.  The amount of time and brain space that dieting and body image woes take from our lives is debilitating. I’m committed to helping other women normalize their eating patterns and be more accepting of their bodies. Let’s work together to create a flexible, sustainable self-care plan that actually feels good and supportive.
